        <p>This website is about the different parts in the game Istrolid, and when to use each one. before we get into all that, the game itself need a bit of explanation.</p>
        <p>Istrolid is a game about building fleets. In Istrolid, you get a massive number of different parts, and you use those parts to build ships, and with those ships you build fleets, and with those fleets, you fight other fleets. each part has it's own health, weight, and cost. many parts use energy as well. long story short, every part is unique, and is designed to be used in it's own place. I don't want to explain everything, so here's some videos instead:</p>

        <p>Now that we know what Istrolid actually is, let's get into the main theme of this website: finding out what parts to use when. each catagory of parts will be compared separately.</p>
