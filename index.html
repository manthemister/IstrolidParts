      Istrolid is a game about building fleets. In Istrolid, you get a massive number of different parts, and you use those parts to build ships, and with those ships you build fleets, and with those fleets, you fight other fleets. each part has it's own health, weight, and cost. many parts use energy as well. long story short, every part is unique, and is designed to be used in it's own place.
